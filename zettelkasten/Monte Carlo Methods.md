# Monte Carlo Methods
The full [[Episode]] is needed before updates can be made on values.  The value of a state is the average of all returns seen throughout all episodes on that state.

There is low [[Bias]] due to the actual returns being used in estimating.  However, there is high [[Variance]] since it relies on complete episodes which can be noisy.
