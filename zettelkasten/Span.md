# Span
A [[vector]] $v$ spans $\mathbb{R}^k$ if $\forall w \in \mathbb{R}^k, \exists \alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k$ such that $w = \sum\alpha_iv_i$

The span is the set of all possible [[Linear Combination]]s of the vectors in $V$:

$$
\text{span}(v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n) = c_1\cdot v_1 + c_2 \cdot v_2 + \dots + c_n \cdot v_n
$$
where $c$ is the set of all possible coefficients.  The resulting [[Vector Subspace]] can be infinitely large due to all possible coefficients.

#### Example:
Given these two vectors:

The span is (taking note that the upper right quadrant is the [[Cone]]):
