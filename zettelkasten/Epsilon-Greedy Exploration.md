# Epsilon-Greedy Exploration
At epsilon fraction of the time, a random action is taken.

$$
\epsilon = 0 \rightarrow \text{greedy exploration is always chosen}
$$
$$
\epsilon \gt 0 \rightarrow \text{random action has a probability of being chosen}
$$
In general, epsilon = 0 is not a great strategy since it means exploration never occurs.
