# Markov Decision Process
These problems have the [[Markov Property]].

[[Action]]s are taken based on the current [[State]].  The whole process unfolds over time, unlike [[Bandit]] problems such as [[Multi-Armed Bandit]]; decisions made influence future states.

A [[Transition Function]] and [[Reward Function]] are used.
