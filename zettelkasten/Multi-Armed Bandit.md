# Multi-Armed Bandit
A problem space where an [[Agent]] faces multiple choices.  One method for choosing an action is [[Epsilon-Greedy Exploration]].  After choosing an action, the agent analyses the returned [[Reward]].

The rewards are part of an unknown [[Probability Distribution]].

Typically, Multi-Armed Bandit problems do not have a [[State]].
