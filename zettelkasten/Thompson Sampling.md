# Thompson Sampling
Has similar properties to [[Upper Confidence Bound]].

It fits a distribution of what is the likely value for a specific action.  For example, in [[Multi-Armed Bandit]], for action 2, there would be a [[Gaussian/Normal Distribution]] of the possible rewards for that action.

Overall, Thompson Sampling empirically seems to be the best.
