# Normal Cone
The [[Polar Cone]] of the [[Tangent Cone]].

#### Example:
The normal cone of $X$ at $x_1$ (an interior point) is all of the vectors that make a greater than or equal to 90 degrees to all of the vectors (the [[Tangent Cone]] of $x_1$).
$$
N_X(x_1) = \{0\}
$$
The normal cone of $X$ at $x_2$ is the set of vectors starting at $x_2$ that makes a greater than or equal to 90 degree angle with everything in that subspace (which would be the perpendicular vector.

The normal cone of $X$ at $x_3$ is the 90 degree offset at $x_3$.
