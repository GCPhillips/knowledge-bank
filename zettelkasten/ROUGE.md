# ROUGE
Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation

Metrics used for evaluating [[Summarization]] tasks.

### ROUGE-N
Measures the number of matching [[n-Gram]]s between the generated text and the reference manually created

### ROUGE-1
Measurements using [[1-Gram]]s only.  For example:

###### ROUGE-1 Precision:
**Generated Text:** "The cat is on the mat."
**Reference Text:** "The cat and the dog."

Precision = 3/5 ("The", "cat", "the")
