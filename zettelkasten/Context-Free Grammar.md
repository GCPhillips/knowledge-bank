# Context-Free Grammar
A set of rules for a grammar that describe how words can form a sentence without context of their surrounding words.

They contain a set of:

**N**: Non-terminals
**T**: Terminals
**S**: Start Symbol
**R**: Rules

For example:
```
S -> NP VP 
NP -> Det N 
VP -> V NP 
Det -> "The" 
N -> "cat" 
V -> "chased"
```
