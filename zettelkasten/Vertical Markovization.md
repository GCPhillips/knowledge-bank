# Vertical Markovization
A [[Markovization]] process where the parent [[non-terminal]] identity is added to each non-terminal node.  This gives more [[context]] which improves the accuracy.

"*This improves accuracy by enabling the parser to make more fine-grained distinctions, which better capture real linguistic phenomena*" - Eisenstein

This does increase the size of the grammar but it enables to model distributions in a more finer-grained way.
