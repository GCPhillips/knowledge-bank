$$
a \times \sum_{k = 0}^\infty n^k = \frac{a}{(1 - n)}
$$
##### Rewards Every x Steps
Taken from homework 3.7

Suppose that a [[Reward]] of +10 is given every 5 steps with a discount ($\gamma$) of 0.9.  Then the equation is:

$$
10 \times \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^{5k} = \frac{1}{1 - (\gamma)^5} = \frac{1}{1 - (0.9)^5} = 24.419
$$
