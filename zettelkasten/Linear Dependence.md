# Linear Dependence
(see [[Linear Independence]])

If there exists in a set of [[vector]]s $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$ two or more vectors that are a multiple of each other, they are linearly dependent.

The vectors that are linearly dependent are on the same plane (since one is a [[scalar]] multiple of the other).  In other words, they are on the same line, or are collinear.

Another way to look at it, if there exists **non-zero** [[scalar]]s $c_1$ and $c_2$ where the [[Linear Combination]] of two vectors is:
$$
c_1 \cdot v + c_2 \cdot w = 0
$$
then the vectors $v$ and $w$ are linearly dependent.
