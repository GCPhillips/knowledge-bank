# Affine Set
A set of points such that any line segment connecting two points in the set lies entirely within the set.

In other words, given a line (which infinitely goes in either direction), any two points in that line that create a line segment is part of the affine set.  Mathematically:
$$
\theta x_1 + (1 - \theta)x_2
$$
where $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$, $x_1, x_2 \in \text{any two points on the line}$

An affine set is a [[Convex Set]].

#### Example:
The solution set of linear equations:
$$
\{x | Ax = b\}
$$
