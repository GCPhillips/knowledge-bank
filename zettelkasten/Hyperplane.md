# Hyperplane
A [[subspace]] of one dimension less than its ambient space.

It is a flat [[affine]] subspace that divides the space into two [[Halfspace]]s.


$$
H_{s,b} = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n: s^Tx = b\}, s \neq 0
$$
where $s$ is the [[Normal Vector]] to the hyperplane, $x$ is a [[vector]] of coordinates, and $b$ is a constant.

There are two [[Halfspace]]s in a hyperplane:
$$
\begin{flalign}
H_{s,b}^+ &= \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n: s^Tx \geq b\}, \\
H_{s,b}^- &= \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n: s^Tx \leq b\}
\end{flalign}
$$
