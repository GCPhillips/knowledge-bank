# Copositive
A symmetric [[matrix]] $M$ is copositive if:
$$
x^TMx \geq 0, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}_+^n
$$
This is similar to the definition of [[Positive Semidefinite]] but is not the same; the distinction is with the vector $x$:
- Copositive - $x$ can only have components that are $\geq 0$
- PSD - $x$ can only have components that are $\gt 0$
