# Deterministic Transition Function
The deterministic probability of landing in state $s'$ and receiving reward $r$ given that the [[Agent]] is in state $s$ and took action $a$.  In other words, taking action $a$ from state $s$ will give reward $r$ and land in state $s'$ 100% of the time.

$$
p(s', r | s, a) = 1
$$
