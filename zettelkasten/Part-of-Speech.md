# Part-of-Speech
A technique of understanding a language on a deeper level.  [[Tag]]s are added to words to give more meaning, such as:

"cat" -> Noun
"and" -> Conjunction

Paths can be created for words that have multiple tags to see which structure is most likely.

#### Categories
##### Open-Class
New words can join (e.g. a new company who has a name that does not exist yet could be added here).

- Nouns: 
	- Proper
	- Common
- Verbs
- Adjectives
- Adverbs

##### Closed-Class
New words can not join; words that are part of the core of a language are here.
- Determiners: "the", "some", "a"
- Conjunctions: "and", "or"
- Pronouns
- Auxilliaries: "had (Verb)"
- Modals: "could"
- Prepositions: "up", "in", "to"
- Particles: "made up" (i.e. a word combined with a verb to give semantics)
