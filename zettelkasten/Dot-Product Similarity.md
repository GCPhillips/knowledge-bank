# Dot-Product Similarity
A measurement of how similar two vectors are.

#### Calculation
$$
similarity = a*b
$$
where $a*b$ is the dot product of vectors $a$ and $b$.

#### Interpretation
**positive** $\rightarrow$ the vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction and are correlated (similar)
**negative** $\rightarrow$ the vectors are pointing in opposite directions and are negatively correlated (dissimilar)
**zero** $\rightarrow$ the vectors are orthogonal and have no similarity or correlation
