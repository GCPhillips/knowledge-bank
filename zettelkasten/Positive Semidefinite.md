Properties of psd matrix M:
- M is symmetric
- M has non-negative eigenvalues
	- or equivalently, $x^TMx \geq 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$

A psd [[matrix]] is [[convex]] (i.e. the set of all psd matrices are in the [[Convex Set]]).

Positive Semidefinite matrices are a special case of [[Copositive]] matrices.
This is similar to the definition of [[Copositive]] but is not the same; the distinction is with the vector $x$:
- Copositive - $x$ can only have components that are $\geq 0$
- PSD - $x$ can only have components that are $\gt 0$
