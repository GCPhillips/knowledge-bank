# Semantic Segmentation
A type of [[Segmentation]] where objects in the image are segmented into "stuff" and classified.  For example, blades of grass are NOT segmented individually but grouped together.  People are NOT separated but grouped together.  Therefore, the objects are not distinguised from one another, which is a limitation.
