# Treebank
A [[Corpus]] that has been syntactically and grammatically annotated with a [[Tree]]-like structure to represent their grammatical structure.

Each sentence or text is annotated (manually or automatically) with their grammatical constituents (like words, phrases, etc).

#### Pre-processing
When pre-processing a treebank, the typical process is:

1. Supply [[Vertical Markovization]]
2. Apply [[Binarization]] and [[Horizontal Markovization]]
