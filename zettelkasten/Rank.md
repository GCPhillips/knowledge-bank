# Rank
The dimension of the [[Span]] of the columns of a [[matrix]] (which is also equivalent to the [[Span]] of the rows).

If $M$ is $n$x$n$, the rank of M is $n$ $\iff$ the [[Determinant]] of M = 0.

In other words, rank is the dimension of the output from the transformation.  If the dimension of the output is a line, it is a rank of 1.  If it is 2, it is a plane.  etc.

The number of dimensions in the [[Column Space]].
