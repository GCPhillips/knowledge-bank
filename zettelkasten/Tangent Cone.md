# Tangent Cone
The tangent cone of $x$ at any point in the set $X$ is defined as the closure of all directions you're allowed to move in:
$$
T_X(x): \text{if\ $x$ is an internal point of $X$ (i.e. $x \in$ interior of $X$), then $T_X(x) = \mathbb{R}^n$}
$$

#### Goal:
$$
\begin{flalign}
\text{min}&: f(x) \\
\text{s.t.}&: x \in X
\end{flalign}
$$
#### Example:
For $x = x_2: T_X(x_2)$ = indicated [[Halfspace]] (to the right of the tangent line)
For $x = x_3: T_X(x_3)$ = cone defined by two boundary [[vector]]s
