# Linear Map
aka [[Linear Transformation]].

A function between two [[Vector Space]]s with vector addition and multiplication preserved.

$$
T: V \rightarrow W
$$
The linear map $T$ is a linear map if for all vectors $u, v \in V$ and scalars $c$, it satisfies:
- $T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v)$
- $T(cu) = cT(u)$

Linear maps can be represented by matrices, but not all linear maps have a [[matrix]] representation (the matrix depends on the choice of bases (tag: [[Basis]]) from the vectors involved).

In other words, a [[matrix]] is a specific representation of a linear map while a linear map is a general concept that describes a mathematical function between vector spaces.
