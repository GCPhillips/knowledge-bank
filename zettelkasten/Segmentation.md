# Segmentation
One of the possible tasks for [[Computer Vision]].  Objects in an image are segmented in a pixel-wise way instead of using region-based object detection.  This is good for grouping "stuff" together, like the pixels that make up a road or a group of people.  It can also be used to segment individual objects, such as individual people as separate objects.
