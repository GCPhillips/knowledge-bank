# Sparsity
As a [[vector]] has more zeros, it is more sparse.

Having sparsity in a feature vector allows a model to only focus on the features and help reduce influence from outliers.  One example of this is the [[Lasso Regression]] problem.  The [[1-Norm]] term in the Lasso function promotes sparsity.
