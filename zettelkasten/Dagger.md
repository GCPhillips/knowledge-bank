# Dagger
An algorithm that is a variant of [[Imitation Learning]].

Instead of the expert providing all of the data, the agent produces an action which is used to control the actor/environment.  The expert then "corrects" the agent by providing information on what they should have done in that scenario.  The expert only participates with providing information and does not actually control the actor/environment.  The agent then begins to learn from their mistakes.

Difficulties:
- Still a large amount of data to collect, like Imitation Learning
