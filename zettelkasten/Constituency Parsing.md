# Constituency Parsing
A technique for parsing out a sentence into a [[Tree]] to give structural meaning to the sentence.  

The last layer (before the leaves) are the [[Part-of-Speech]] [[Tag]]s for the words in the [[Sentence]].

The tree can have ambiguities if it is not parsed correctly (i.e. the sentence can take on a different meaning than intended).

Can be thought of as the structure of a [[Context-Free Grammar]].

The tree is not necessarily binary only.
