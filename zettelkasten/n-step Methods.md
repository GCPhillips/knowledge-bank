# n-step Methods
Similar to [[Temporal Difference Methods]] but generalized.

Updates are made using the rewards and values observed over n time steps instead of 1 step as seen in TD methods.

Allows for a trade-off between [[Bias]] and [[Variance]].

If $n = \infty$, this is [[Monte Carlo Methods]].
