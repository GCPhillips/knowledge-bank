# Cosine Similarity
A measurement of how similar two vectors are.

#### Calculation
$$
similarity = \frac{a * b}{|a||b|}
$$
where $a*b$ is the dot product of vectors $a$ and $b$,
$|a|$ is the magnitude of vector $a$.

#### Interpretation
Similarity of:
**1** $\rightarrow$ the vectors point in the same direction and are identical
**0** $\rightarrow$ the vectors point in opposite directions and are completely dissimilar
**-1** $\rightarrow$ the vectors are orthogonal and have no similarity
