# Cone
A specific type of a [[Convex Set]] that is used to characterize optimality.

It is a set where combinations of [[vector]]s with non-negative scalars stay within the set:

$$
x_1, x_2 \in K \implies \alpha_1 x_1 + \alpha_2 x_2 \in K, \forall \alpha_1, \alpha_2 \geq 0
$$

Many [[Convex Set]]s can be represented as intersections of cones.

The set of all [[Positive Definite]] matrices is a cone.
