# Linear Independence
(see [[Linear Dependence]])

A set of [[vector]]s $v_1,\dots,v_k$ are linearly independent if there is no way to describe one of them as a [[Linear Combination]] of the others.

In other words:
If $\alpha_1v_1 + \alpha_2v_2 + \dots + \alpha_kv_k = 0$, then $\alpha_i = 0, \forall i$

Another example:
If $\alpha_1u + \alpha_2v = 0 \rightarrow \alpha_1u = -\alpha_2v$
$\rightarrow u = (-\frac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_1})v$
The only way for this equation to hold is if $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = 0$, which means $u, v$ are independent.
